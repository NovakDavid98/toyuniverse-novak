## Subject: Persistent `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'` During .npy Saving in GPU Simulation

Dear Scientist,

We're encountering a persistent `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'` in the `id14_id26_simulation.py` script when attempting to save the time-series output data (e.g., `t_values_out`, `psi_id14_values_out`) as `.npy` files. This error occurs specifically when `USE_GPU = True` (CuPy is active).

**Key Observations and Debugging Steps Taken:**

1.  **Error Trigger:** The error arises during the loop that iterates through a dictionary (`required_lists_map`) and attempts to convert lists to NumPy arrays for saving with `np.save()`.
2.  **Minimal Test Case:** We've reduced `t_max` to `0.002` (resulting in only `num_steps = 2`), so the lists being saved are very small.
3.  **Log Truncation Issues:** Initially, verbose debug prints throughout the simulation loop were causing log truncation, obscuring the exact point of failure or the state of variables right before saving.
4.  **Reduced Logging:** We've systematically commented out almost all print statements in the main simulation loop and preceding the NPY saving block to ensure diagnostic prints related to saving are visible.
5.  **Targeted Diagnostics & `sys.exit()`:**
    *   We added print statements to show the `type()` and `len()` of each list just before the `np.array()` conversion and `np.save()` call.
    *   To combat potential truncation, we've been using `import sys; sys.exit("debug message")` to force the script to terminate immediately after specific diagnostic prints.
    *   **Puzzling Behavior:** The traceback *consistently* points to the line of code *immediately preceding* the `sys.exit()` call, even when `sys.exit()` is placed as the very first line inside the `try` block dedicated to NPY saving.
    *   For instance, if `sys.exit()` is the first line in the `try` block, the error is reported on the `print("INFO: Attempting to save time-series data to .npy files...", flush=True)` line, which is right *before* the `try` block.

6.  **Current State:**
    *   The most recent run still produced the `TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'`, with the traceback pointing to line 612: `print("INFO: Attempting to save time-series data to .npy files...", flush=True)`.
    *   Our `sys.exit()` call was placed on line 616, as the first statement inside the subsequent `try` block.
    *   This suggests the error might be triggered by operations immediately preceding the NPY saving loop, such as `gc.collect()` (line 609) or `print_memory_usage("Before NPY Saving Block")` (line 610 in the previous version, now commented out), or even the definition/evaluation of the `required_lists_map` dictionary, in a way that isn't immediately obvious.

**Hypothesis:**
One of the lists intended for saving (e.g., `t_values_out`, `psi_id14_values_out`, etc.) is, or contains, a `set` object, which `np.array()` cannot convert directly if the elements are unhashable or if it's trying to create an object array of sets. The mystery is why our diagnostic prints, designed to catch this by checking `type()` right before conversion, are not appearing before the crash, or why the crash point seems to shift just before our `sys.exit()`.

**Question for You:**
Given this behavior, particularly the traceback consistently pointing to the line *before* our `sys.exit()` and the failure to see targeted diagnostic prints for the lists themselves:
*   Do you have any insights into what might be causing this `TypeError` to manifest in such an elusive way?
*   Are there any subtle interactions with CuPy arrays, garbage collection (`gc.collect()`), or the `globals()` dictionary access within the loop that might lead to such an error before our specific list diagnostics can run or be seen?
*   Could the issue be with the `required_lists_map` dictionary itself, or how its items are being processed before the loop explicitly starts?
*   What alternative debugging strategies would you recommend to definitively isolate which variable is the `set` and where it's being converted to a `set`?

We will provide the latest version of the `id14_id26_simulation.py` script for your review. We're currently trying to comment out the `gc.collect()` and `print_memory_usage()` calls just before the NPY saving `try` block to see if that changes the behavior.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
