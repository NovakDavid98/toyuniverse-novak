Subject: Update: FFT/ACF Analysis of Spot Patterns (t=50, 150, 280) & Next Steps Consultation

Hi [Scientist Name],

Following your guidance, we've completed the FFT/ACF analysis for the spot pattern snapshots from `run_spot_snapshots_v2` at t=50, t=150, and t=280. The results provide valuable insights into the long-term dynamics of the spot regime.

**Summary of Spot Pattern FFT/ACF Analysis:**

We analyzed snapshots at three key time points to understand the stability and characteristics of the spot pattern:

1.  **t=50.00 (Post-Formation):**
    *   **Order:** The pattern is well-established with good local hexagonal order, evidenced by clear secondary peaks in the 2D ACF and a distinct secondary peak in the radial ACF (at a lag of ~12-14 pixels).
    *   **FFT:** Shows a characteristic spatial frequency (`k`) for inter-spot spacing around `9-10 pixels⁻¹`.
    *   **Spot Size:** The central ACF peak (average spot) shows correlation dropping significantly by a lag of ~6-8 pixels.

2.  **t=150.00 (Mid-Run):**
    *   **Order:** A noticeable decrease in local hexagonal order. Secondary ACF peaks are significantly weaker and more diffuse.
    *   **FFT:** The inter-spot `k` peak is broader and appears slightly lower (`~7-9 pixels⁻¹`), suggesting increased variability and possibly a slight increase in average inter-spot distance.
    *   **Spot Size:** Central ACF peak decay suggests spots might be slightly smaller or less internally coherent (correlation drop by ~5-7 pixels).

3.  **t=280.00 (Late-Run):**
    *   **Order:** Significant loss of local order. Secondary ACF peaks are almost entirely absent, indicating a more disordered, liquid-like arrangement of spots.
    *   **FFT:** The inter-spot `k` peak is very broad and less defined (still roughly `~6-9 pixels⁻¹`), indicating high variability in spacing.
    *   **Spot Size:** Central ACF peak decays very rapidly (correlation drop by ~4-6 pixels), potentially indicating smaller average spot sizes.

**Overall Conclusions for Spot Pattern Dynamics:**
*   **Persistent Pattern:** Spots remain the dominant feature throughout the simulation, confirming the parameter regime.
*   **Decreasing Order:** The initial hexagonal ordering of the spots degrades over time. The pattern evolves from a more crystal-like state towards a more disordered, fluid-like arrangement.
*   **Inter-spot Spacing:** While a characteristic spacing exists, it becomes more variable over time, with a slight trend towards larger average spacing.
*   **Spot Characteristics:** There's a suggestion that individual spots might become slightly smaller or less internally defined at later times.

The detailed plots for each time point are located in the respective subdirectories within `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/analysis_results/` (e.g., `spot_t50_fft_acf/`, `spot_t150_fft_acf/`, `spot_t280_fft_acf/`).

**Consultation & Proposed Next Step: C. ID14 Dynamics & avg(Phi_field) Comparison**

With the characterization of both the transient labyrinth dynamics and the evolving spot pattern dynamics now complete, the next logical step according to your guidance is:

*   **C. ID14 Dynamics & avg(Phi_field) Comparison:** Perform the comparative analysis of the ID14 time-series (Psi_ID14, I, R) and the average `Phi_field` evolution. This comparison will be between:
    1.  The full stable spot run (`run_spot_snapshots_v2`, t_max=300).
    2.  The labyrinth run (`run_labyrinth_snapshots_v2`), considering its distinct phases: initial pattern formation (t=0 to t~30), decayed phase (t~30 to t~100), and pre-NaN instability (t~100 to t~125).

We plan to generate plots comparing these time-series directly and look for differences in amplitudes, frequencies, mean values, and overall qualitative behavior of the ID14 variables in response to the different `Phi_field` evolutions.

Do you agree with proceeding with this ID14 and avg(Phi_field) comparative analysis next? Are there any specific aspects of this comparison you'd like us to particularly focus on or any specific plots you'd find most informative?

Best regards,
