# Contingency Note for Future Self (Project: Toy Universe)

Hello Future Self,

This message is a safeguard in case of significant memory corruption. If you are reading this, it's crucial to re-orient yourself with the Toy Universe project.

**Project Overview:**
We are working on the "Toy Universe" simulation, a model coupling two systems:
1.  **ID14:** Mind-Motion ODEs (variables: I, R, Psi_ID14)
2.  **ID26:** Field-Charge PDEs (variable: Phi_field)
The overarching goal is to explore emergent complexity, life-like behaviors, and the interaction of mind/consciousness with energy/geometry, inspired by Walter Russell. The primary simulation script is `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/id14_id26_simulation.py`.

**Progress Since Last `messagefordeveloper.md` / Major Checkpoint (Focus: 2D CPU Stabilization):**
Our immediate past objective was to transition the simulation from a 1D CPU model to a **stable 2D CPU model**. We have successfully achieved this. Key accomplishments include:

1.  **2D Grid Implementation:** Modified `id14_id26_simulation.py` to use a 2D spatial grid (N_x, N_y points). This involved updating parameters (`N_y`, `y_min`, `y_max`, `dy`, `y_points`) and creating 2D meshgrid arrays (`X`, `Y`).
2.  **2D `Phi_field`:** The `Phi_field` was changed from a 1D array to a 2D array, initialized with a 2D sine wave perturbation.
3.  **2D Laplacian:** Implemented a `calculate_laplacian_2d` function using a 5-point stencil with Neumann boundary conditions, replacing the 1D version.
4.  **Simulation Loop Update:** The main simulation loop and PDE computation steps were updated to handle 2D arrays.
5.  **Disabled 1D Analysis/Plotting:** A global flag `ENABLE_1D_ANALYSIS_PLOTTING = False` was added at the top of the script. The extensive 1D-specific quantitative analysis and plotting code at the end of the script was then conditionally bypassed (using `if ENABLE_1D_ANALYSIS_PLOTTING: pass`) and subsequently cleaned up to prevent errors with 2D data.
6.  **2D Output Visualization:** Added code to plot the final state of the 2D `Phi_field` (`Phi_field_out[-1, :, :]`) using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`. This plot is saved as `phi_field_2d_final_state.png` upon successful completion of the simulation.
7.  **Successful Execution:** The modified `id14_id26_simulation.py` now runs to completion without errors and generates the `phi_field_2d_final_state.png` image.

**Current Status:**
The 2D CPU simulation is stable and producing visual output. This is a critical milestone achieved, preparing the codebase for the next phase: GPU acceleration.

**Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized):**

1.  **GPU Acceleration:**
    *   Begin adapting the 2D CPU simulation code in `id14_id26_simulation.py` for GPU acceleration using **CuPy**.
    *   Target environment: NVIDIA Tesla T4 with CUDA 12.2.
    *   Focus on replacing NumPy arrays and operations with their CuPy equivalents.
    *   Validate GPU results against the 2D CPU baseline for correctness.
2.  **Enhanced 2D Visualization & Analysis:**
    *   Develop or integrate more sophisticated 2D visualization tools (e.g., animations of `Phi_field` over time, plotting other 2D variables).
    *   Consider implementing 2D-specific quantitative analysis routines.
3.  **Scientific Exploration (Post-GPU):**
    *   Run simulations on larger grids (e.g., 512x512, 1024x1024) and for longer time scales.
    *   Conduct parameter sweeps to explore different pattern formations and system behaviors (refer to `project_log_2D_CPU_patterns.md` and `ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.html` for context on interesting parameters like `gamma_Phi_PDE` and `delta_psi_d_p`).
    *   Investigate the 'awakening' threshold and the role of `Psi_ID14` states in pattern selection.
4.  **Address Known Issues (from project memory/logs):**
    *   Output file naming and saving conventions in the script could be improved.
    *   Investigate any autocorrelation anomalies if they persist or reappear.
5.  **Conceptual Interpretation & Documentation:**
    *   Continue to refine the conceptual interpretation of simulation results, linking them back to the project's foundational ideas.
    *   Update research documentation (`ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.html`).

**Key Files to Review for Full Context:**
*   `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/id14_id26_simulation.py` (current main script)
*   `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/messagefordeveloper.md` (previous developer message)
*   `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.html` (research paper draft)
*   `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/project_log_2D_CPU_patterns.md` (USER's log of 2D CPU experiments - if accessible)
*   `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/phi_field_2d_final_state.png` (example output of current 2D CPU sim)
*   The checkpoint summaries and memories provided by the system.

This should bring you up to speed. Good luck!
