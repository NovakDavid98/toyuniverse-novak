Subject: Quick Consultation: Need to Re-run Long Spot-Forming Simulation

Dear Expert Scientist,

Apologies for this quick follow-up. As we were preparing the side-by-side comparative snapshots you requested, we discovered an issue with our archived spot-forming data.

It appears that the detailed time-series data (.npy files) and the individual frame images (in `seriesofimages_spot/`) for the spot-forming regime currently correspond to a very short test run (t_max=0.1) rather than the full t_max=300.0 simulation (Command ID 282 from our records, which did complete successfully).

While the main animation (`phi_field_animation_spot.gif`) and final state image (`phi_field_2d_final_state_spot.png`) for the spot regime seem to be from the correct long run, the critical detailed data for in-depth analysis (like frame-by-frame comparison and full time-series for FFTs) is from the short run.

To ensure our comparative analysis is accurate and based on complete datasets for both regimes, we propose to re-run the long spot-forming simulation (t_max=300.0) with the established spot-forming parameters (`gamma_Phi_PDE = 0.01`, `Phi0_saturation_alpha = 0.5`, `Phi0_saturation_epsilon = 0.5`). We will then carefully archive all its outputs (animation, frame series, .npy files) under a clear naming convention (e.g., suffixing with `_spot_corrected`) before proceeding with the detailed comparative analysis you outlined.

Could you please quickly confirm if this approach is okay? We want to ensure we're on the right track before committing to another ~30-40 minute simulation run.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
