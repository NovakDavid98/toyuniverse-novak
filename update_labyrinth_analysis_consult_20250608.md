Subject: Update: Labyrinth Decay Quantified & Initial FFT/ACF for t=20 Labyrinth

Hi [Scientist Name],

We've made further progress in analyzing the labyrinthine pattern dynamics from the `run_labyrinth_snapshots_v2` simulation:

**1. Labyrinth Pattern Decay and Instability - Detailed Timeline:**

*   **Quantitative Decay:** We analyzed the spatial variance of `Phi_field` over time. This quantitatively confirmed our earlier visual observations: the labyrinth pattern forms, then rapidly decays to a near-homogeneous state (very low variance) by approximately t=25-30. This low-variance state persists until around t=100.
*   **Pre-NaN Instability:** Between t=100 and t=125, the simulation exhibits large, sudden spikes in spatial variance. Visual inspection of the snapshots from this period (t=100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125) reveals that these spikes are caused by the emergence of isolated, large-amplitude, negative "spots" or "holes" and scattered high-contrast speckles. These appear to be numerical artifacts or a form of localized instability rather than a re-emergence of a structured pattern.
*   **NaN Confirmation:** The script confirmed that NaNs first appear in the snapshot at t=130.00, halting further variance analysis at t=125.00.
*   The `labyrinth_variance_decay.png` and `labyrinth_spike_snapshots.png` plots detailing these findings are in the main project directory.

**2. FFT/ACF Analysis of Labyrinth Snapshot at t=20:**

We performed an FFT and ACF analysis on the `phi_snapshot_step0002000_t20.00.npy` file, which shows a clear labyrinthine structure:

*   **2D Power Spectrum (FFT):** Shows a diffuse, isotropic (circular) ring of high power, characteristic of labyrinthine patterns. This suggests a dominant wavelength with a range of orientations.
*   **Radially Averaged Power Spectrum:** Reveals a dominant peak at a spatial frequency `k` of approximately **4-5 pixels<sup>-1</sup>**.
*   **2D Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** Displays a central peak. The correlation drops off and becomes slightly negative around this peak, indicating typical spacing.
*   **Radially Averaged ACF:** Shows a rapid decay from the central peak, crossing zero at a lag distance of about **8-10 pixels**, with a shallow trough (minimum correlation) around **10-12 pixels**.

These FFT/ACF results are consistent with the visual appearance of the t=20 labyrinth, indicating characteristic length scales for strand width and spacing. The plots are located in `/teamspace/studios/this_studio/toyuniverse-novak/analysis_results/labyrinth_t20_fft_acf/`.

**Consultation & Proposed Next Steps:**

With this detailed understanding of the labyrinth simulation's evolution (formation, rapid decay, late-stage instability), we propose to proceed with the following from our agreed "Analysis - Phase 1" plan:

*   **A. Spot Patterns Analysis:** Conduct a full FFT/ACF analysis on selected spot pattern snapshots from `run_spot_snapshots_v2` (e.g., at early, mid, and late stages like t=50, t=150, t=280). This will allow us to characterize their dominant wavelengths, inter-spot spacing, and FFT peak sharpness for comparison.
*   **C. ID14 Dynamics & avg(Phi_field) Comparison:** Perform a comparative analysis of the ID14 dynamics and the average `Phi_field` evolution between the stable spot run and the early, valid portion of the labyrinth run (up to t=100).

Could you please advise on which of these tasks you'd prefer us to prioritize next?

1.  FFT/ACF analysis of the **spot patterns**.
2.  The **ID14 dynamics and avg(Phi_field) comparison**.
3.  Alternatively, if there's any specific aspect of the recent labyrinth findings (decay, instability, t=20 FFT/ACF) you'd like us to explore further before moving on.

We look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

[Your Name/Cascade Team]
