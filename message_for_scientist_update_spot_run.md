**Subject: Update & Guidance Request: Long Spot-Forming Simulation Attempt**

Dear Expert Scientist,

Following your guidance, we proceeded with the high-priority task of running the spot-forming parameter set (`gamma_Phi_PDE = 0.01`, `Phi0_saturation_alpha/epsilon = 0.5`, `k_R_phi_prime=0.01`) for an extended duration (`t_max = 300.0`) using the 'hot' colormap.

**Outcome of the Simulation Attempt:**

*   The simulation (Command ID `247`) was initiated as planned.
*   Unfortunately, the simulation was **canceled** after approximately 25-30 minutes of runtime.
*   It had completed around 34,263 steps out of the intended 300,000 steps.
*   Consequently, we did not obtain the final `phi_field_2d_final_state.png` or `phi_field_animation.gif` for this specific long spot-forming run. The files currently in the directory with these names belong to the previously successful `t_max=300.0` *labyrinthine* simulation.

We are unsure of the reason for the cancellation at this time (it could have been a manual interruption or a system-level issue).

**Request for Guidance:**

Given this outcome, we would appreciate your direction on how to proceed:

1.  **Re-attempt Long Spot-Forming Run:** Should we immediately try to re-run the same long spot-forming simulation (`t_max=300.0`)?
2.  **Shorter Test Run First:** Would it be prudent to first attempt a shorter spot-forming run (e.g., `t_max=80.0`, which previously took ~10-15 minutes for labyrinthine) with the current parameters to see if it completes successfully, before committing to another ~1-hour run? This might help rule out any subtle parameter interaction causing instability, though the cancellation cause is unknown.
3.  **Alternative Focus:** Should we temporarily pivot to one of the other priorities you outlined (e.g., deeper analysis of the *existing* successful long labyrinthine run, or preparing for the `delta_psi_d_p` / `k_R_phi_prime` sweep) while we investigate potential reasons for the cancellation?
4.  **Other Actions:** Do you have other suggestions?

Your input on the next best step would be invaluable.
