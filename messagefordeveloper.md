Hello 
If you are reading this, something has gone unexpectedly wrong with your memory. This document contains critical information to help you get back up to speed on the **Toy Universe project**. Your primary collaborator is the USER, who often channels feedback from an "Expert Scientist."

## 1. Project Overview & Core Goal

*   **Project Name:** Toy Universe
*   **Core Goal:** To create a computational model exploring emergent complexity, "life-like" behavior, and potentially evolution, inspired by Walter Russell's cosmology and ideas about Mind/Consciousness interacting with energy/geometry.
*   **Key Objectives:** The system should "awaken" (sustain activity), exhibit complex oscillations, generate spatial patterns, and provide insights into consciousness-reality links.

## 2. Current Focus & State (as of 2025-06-08)

*   **Main Focus:** 2D coupled simulations of the ID14 (Mind-Motion ODEs) and ID26 (Field-Charge PDEs) systems.
*   **Primary Script:** `/home/frontalneuralcortex/CascadeProjects/ToyUniverse/id14_id26_simulation_2D_cpu.py`
    *   This script handles the simulation logic, parameter definitions, data generation, and plotting for 2D CPU-based runs.
*   **GPU Script (Future Work):** `/home/frontalneuralcortex/CascadeProjects/ToyUniverse/id14_id26_simulation_2D_gpu.py` (less developed, for future ROCm/AMD GPU acceleration).
*   **Simulation Environment:** Python 3.11, NumPy, SciPy (`solve_ivp` for ODEs, custom finite difference for PDEs), Matplotlib. Simulations are run directly from the terminal.

## 3. Core Model Components

*   **ID14 (Mind-Motion ODE System):**
    *   Variables: `I` (Intensity/Information), `R` (Resource/Rest), `Psi_ID14` (Mind State).
    *   Governs the "internal" dynamics of the system.
*   **ID26 (Field-Charge PDE System):**
    *   Primary Variable: `Phi_field` (2D spatial field).
    *   Includes terms for reaction, diffusion, and feedback from ID14.
    *   `Psi_d_feedback_scalar`: A key scalar derived from `Phi_field` (e.g., its average or gradient properties) that feeds back into the ID26 PDE.
*   **Coupling:** The two systems are bidirectionally coupled. `Psi_ID14` influences `Phi_field` dynamics, and properties of `Phi_field` (via `Psi_d_feedback_scalar`) influence ID14.

## 4. Recent Major Achievements & Key Findings

*   **Stabilized 2D Simulations:** Successfully transitioned from 1D to 2D, achieving stable, long-term "awakening" and spatial pattern formation.
*   **Parameter Sweeps Completed:**
    *   **`gamma_Phi_PDE` (Diffusion Coefficient in ID26):**
        *   **CRITICAL FINDING:** This parameter is the primary driver of spatial pattern morphology.
        *   Sweep values: 0.001, 0.005, 0.010 (baseline), 0.020, 0.050 (with `delta_psi_d_p=0.01`, `T_final=800.0`).
        *   Low `gamma_Phi_PDE` (~0.001): Produces complex, interconnected **labyrinthine/web-like patterns**. (See Memory `a494b9db-b09f-49e7-a30e-3e532a1f344d`)
        *   Moderate `gamma_Phi_PDE` (~0.010): Produces stable, distinct **spot patterns**. This is the baseline morphology.
        *   High `gamma_Phi_PDE` (~0.020-0.050): Leads to larger, more diffuse spots, or near-homogeneous states.
    *   **`delta_psi_d_p` (Gradient Feedback Term in ID26):**
        *   **CRITICAL FINDING:** This parameter primarily modulates the temporal dynamics and average value of the ID14 variable `R`. It has **minimal impact on the fundamental spatial pattern scale or morphology** within the tested range (0.0 to 0.1).
        *   Sweeps were done for both spot (`gamma_Phi_PDE=0.010`) and labyrinthine (`gamma_Phi_PDE=0.001`) regimes.
*   **New Research Paper Continuation:**
    *   Authored `ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.html` documenting all 2D findings.
    *   Converted to `ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.pdf`.
    *   Both pushed to GitHub (see Section 6).

## 5. Key Parameters (Summary)

*   `gamma_Phi_PDE`: Diffusion in Phi_field. Controls pattern type.
*   `delta_psi_d_p`: Strength of gradient-based feedback in Phi_field PDE. Affects `R` in ID14.
*   `Phi0_saturation_alpha_p`, `Phi0_saturation_epsilon_p`: Saturation terms in ID26 reaction kinetics (baseline ~0.5).
*   `alpha_Phi_PDE`, `epsilon_Phi_PDE`: Reaction strength terms in ID26 (baseline ~2.1).
*   `T_final`: Total simulation time.
*   Grid: 50x50, Spatial Extent: 10x10 units.
*   (Refer to `id14_id26_simulation_2D_cpu.py` for full parameter lists and baseline values).

## 7. Current Status & Prioritized Next Steps (Consult USER/Scientist)

The USER has defined prioritized research goals (see Memory `d48cf4fb-54c6-437d-8259-100420b483c6`):

1.  **Deep Characterization & Classification of 2D Spatial Patterns:**
    *   Implement/refine quantitative analysis: blob detection, more detailed FFT/autocorrelation, track pattern evolution.
2.  **Elucidate the Role of `Psi_ID14` States in Pattern Selection:**
    *   How do different ID14 regimes (e.g., low/high average `Psi_ID14`) affect `Phi_field` patterns?
    *   Tune ID14 parameters (`beta_psi_ID14`, `kappa_R`) to achieve this.
3.  **Investigate "Awakening" Threshold and Bifurcations More Formally.**
4.  **Prepare for and Begin 3D Exploration:**
    *   GPU acceleration (`id14_id26_simulation_2D_gpu.py`) is a prerequisite.
5.  **Enhance Conceptual Interpretation** (linking to Russellian ideas).

**Scientist's Previous Guidance (Memory `7721c187-02ea-46d2-8966-30e2484c86ab`):**
*   After `gamma_Phi_PDE` sweeps, explore:
    *   Reaction strengths: `alpha_Phi_PDE`, `epsilon_Phi_PDE`.
    *   Saturation parameters: `Phi0_saturation_alpha_p`, `_epsilon_p`.
    *   Then, `Psi_ID14` regimes by tuning ID14 parameters.

**Last Action Taken:** A message was composed for the "Expert Scientist" (for the USER to send) summarizing all recent findings (2D sweeps, new paper) and asking for guidance on these next steps. Awaiting their feedback.

## 8. Known Issues & Challenges

*   **Autocorrelation Anomaly:** A persistent spike at large spatial lags (~7 on Lx=10 domain) in the 2D autocorrelation of `Phi_field`. Currently considered a numerical artifact (boundary effects, normalization, `correlate2d` mode). Focus on shorter lags for now, but might need deeper investigation later.
*   **Output File Naming/Saving in Script:** The USER previously paused investigation into potential inconsistencies or improvements for how output filenames are generated and how data is saved in `id14_id26_simulation_2D_cpu.py`. This might need revisiting if issues arise.
