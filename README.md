## Welcome to the Toy Universe!

This repository hosts the research, theoretical framework, simulation code, and findings for a novel computational model exploring the coupled dynamics of a hypothetical **Mind-Motion system (ID14)** and a **Field-Charge system (ID26)**. This project, spearheaded by David Novak, delves into the intricate interactions between consciousness-like fields and fundamental physical-like fields within a simulated "Toy Universe."

**Author/Originator:** David Novak
**Simulation & Analysis Support:** Cascade AI
**Date of Public Disclosure:** June 5, 2025

## Project Overview

The core of this research involves Python-based spatial simulations (initially 1D, now extended to 2D) that model:

1.  **ID14 (Mind-Motion Dynamics):** The evolution of internal variables representing Imagination (`I`), Realization (`R`), and a Consciousness Field (`Ψ_ID14`).
2.  **ID26 (Field-Charge Dynamics):** The evolution of a spatially distributed electric potential-like field (`Φ_ID26`), influenced by and influencing charge-like and motion-like entities derived from the ID14 system.

This work focuses on achieving stable, bounded, and physically plausible dynamics in a complex system featuring nonlinear feedback loops. Key aspects include:

*   **Bidirectional Coupling:** `Ψ_ID14` influences `Φ_ID26`, and `Φ_ID26` feeds back into `Ψ_ID14`.
*   **Nonlinear Feedback:** Incremental introduction and tuning of nonlinear terms in the `Φ_ID26` PDE.
*   **Saturation Mechanisms:** Implementation of `tanh` functions to prevent runaway behavior and ensure numerical stability.
*   **Parameter Exploration:** Systematic tuning of coupling constants, damping coefficients, and feedback strengths.
*   **1D Breakthrough:** Achieved a stable, high-activity oscillatory state with sustained `Φ_ID26` field growth in the 1D model, demonstrating the viability of the coupled system (see `paper.md` for details).
*   **2D Breakthrough (CPU):** Successfully extended the simulation to 2D on CPU (`id14_id26_simulation_2D_cpu.py`). Key achievements include:
    *   Attaining sustained high-amplitude growth of the `Φ_ID26` field.
    *   Observing the emergence of distinct spatial patterns (e.g., spots/peaks) by tuning saturation mechanisms and significantly reducing the diffusion coefficient (`gamma_Phi_p`). (See `project_log_2D_CPU_patterns_2025-06-06.md` for details).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NovakDavid98/toyuniverse-novak.git
    cd toyuniverse-novak
    ```
2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    The simulation script `id14_id26_simulation.py` requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `scipy`
    *   `matplotlib`

    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Run the simulation:**
    (Ensure `id14_id26_simulation.py` is in the root directory or adjust path accordingly)
    ```bash
    python id14_id26_simulation.py # For 1D simulation
    # or
    python id14_id26_simulation_2D_cpu.py # For 2D CPU simulation
    ```
    This will generate output plots in the same directory.

4.  **Converting `simulation.md` to PDF (Optional):**
    A Python script `md_to_pdf_converter.py` is provided to convert `simulation.md` into a styled PDF document (`simulation.pdf`).
    *   **Additional Dependencies for PDF Conversion:**
        ```bash
        pip install markdown2 weasyprint
        ```
        On Linux (like Fedora), `WeasyPrint` also requires system libraries:
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install pango cairo gdk-pixbuf2 libffi-devel
        ```
    *   **Run the PDF converter:**
        ```bash
        python md_to_pdf_converter.py
        ```

## Future Directions

Building on recent successes, future work includes:
*   **2D Pattern Characterization:** In-depth analysis of the newly observed spatial patterns in the 2D CPU simulation (stability, wavelength, type, influence of parameters like `delta_psi_d_p`).
*   **Exploring 2D Parameter Space:** Further tuning of diffusion (`gamma_Phi_p`), reaction terms, and ID14 parameters in the 2D model to understand pattern selection and achieve different dynamic regimes (e.g., patterned states with lower `Psi_ID14` oscillations).
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Adapting the 2D simulation for GPU (ROCm) to enable larger/longer simulations and more rapid parameter exploration.
*   **Numerical Refinements:** Assessing and improving grid resolution and time-stepping for sharp patterns as needed.
*   Continued investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of the observed phenomena.
