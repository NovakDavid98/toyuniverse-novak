## Welcome to the Toy Universe!

This repository hosts the research, theoretical framework, simulation code, and findings for a novel computational model exploring the coupled dynamics of a hypothetical **Mind-Motion system (ID14)** and a **Field-Charge system (ID26)**. This project, spearheaded by David Novak, delves into the intricate interactions between consciousness-like fields and fundamental physical-like fields within a simulated "Toy Universe."

**Author/Originator:** David Novak
**Simulation & Analysis Support:** Cascade AI
**Date of Public Disclosure:** June 5, 2025

## Project Overview

The core of this research is a Python-based 1D spatial simulation that models:

1.  **ID14 (Mind-Motion Dynamics):** The evolution of internal variables representing Imagination (`I`), Realization (`R`), and a Consciousness Field (`Ψ_ID14`).
2.  **ID26 (Field-Charge Dynamics):** The evolution of a spatially distributed electric potential-like field (`Φ_ID26`), influenced by and influencing charge-like and motion-like entities derived from the ID14 system.

This work focuses on achieving stable, bounded, and physically plausible dynamics in a complex system featuring nonlinear feedback loops. Key aspects include:

*   **Bidirectional Coupling:** `Ψ_ID14` influences `Φ_ID26`, and `Φ_ID26` feeds back into `Ψ_ID14`.
*   **Nonlinear Feedback:** Incremental introduction and tuning of nonlinear terms in the `Φ_ID26` PDE.
*   **Saturation Mechanisms:** Implementation of `tanh` functions to prevent runaway behavior and ensure numerical stability.
*   **Parameter Exploration:** Systematic tuning of coupling constants, damping coefficients, and feedback strengths.
*   **Recent Breakthrough:** Successfully achieved a stable, high-activity oscillatory state with sustained `Φ_ID26` field growth, demonstrating the viability of the coupled system under specific parameter conditions (see `paper.md` for details).

*   **`LICENSE`:** Declaration of Prior Art. This document outlines the terms under which this work is shared, emphasizing its status as publicly disclosed prior art while retaining rights for commercial application by the author.
*   **`id14_id26_simulation.py`:** The main Python simulation script.
*   **`research.md`:** Supporting research notes and conceptual development by David Novak.
*   **`plots/`:** This directory contains visualizations generated by the simulation, such as:
    *   `id14_id26_simulation_plot_summary.png`
    *   `id14_id26_simulation_plot_phi_heatmap.png`
    *   And any other relevant plots.
*   **`/data/` (directory, example):** If you have raw simulation output data files, they can be stored here. (You'll need to create this and add your data).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NovakDavid98/toyuniverse-novak.git
    cd toyuniverse-novak
    ```
2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    The simulation script `id14_id26_simulation.py` requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `scipy`
    *   `matplotlib`

    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Run the simulation:**
    (Ensure `id14_id26_simulation.py` is in the root directory or adjust path accordingly)
    ```bash
    python id14_id26_simulation.py
    ```
    This will generate output plots in the same directory.
