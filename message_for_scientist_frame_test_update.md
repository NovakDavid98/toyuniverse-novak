**Subject: Successful Test of Individual Frame Saving & Next Steps for Analysis**

Dear Expert Scientist,

Following up on our readiness to enter the analysis phase, we have a positive update on our data generation capabilities.

We successfully modified the `id14_id26_simulation.py` script to save not only the animated GIF but also each individual frame of the `Phi_field` evolution as a separate PNG image into a `seriesofimages` directory.

A short test run (`t_max=2.0`) was conducted to verify this new feature. The simulation completed successfully, and the output log confirmed that the process of saving individual frames (e.g., `frame_0001.png` at PDE Step 0, `frame_0002.png` at PDE Step 1000) worked as expected. The visual output from these frames, using the 'hot' colormap, clearly captures the `Phi_field` at each saved step.

This enhancement provides us with a much more granular dataset for detailed frame-by-frame examination, which could be invaluable for:
*   Pinpointing the exact timing of specific events (like the "awakening").
*   Analyzing transient phenomena in detail.
*   Extracting specific high-resolution snapshots for quantitative analysis (FFT, ACF, etc.) at any point where a frame was saved.

We have already prepared a general message (`message_for_scientist_analysis_phase.md`) outlining the completion of the long spot-forming run and our readiness for the broader analysis plan you previously suggested.

Before we dive deep into comparing the full long runs (labyrinthine vs. spot-forming), we wanted to share this specific update. Could you provide any initial thoughts or guidance on how this new frame-by-frame data might best be leveraged, perhaps for some initial exploratory analysis or to refine our approach to the quantitative metrics?

We believe this capability significantly enhances our analytical toolkit.
