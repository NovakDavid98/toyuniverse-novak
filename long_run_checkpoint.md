# Toy Universe Simulation - Long Run Checkpoint & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-06-08 00:29 UTC

## 1. Purpose of this Document

This document provides a snapshot of the ongoing Toy Universe simulation activities and outlines the immediate next steps. It is intended to be read after reviewing the broader project context in:
- `paper.md` (Original research/project notes)
- `ToyUniverse_Research_Paper.pdf` (Formal paper draft)
- `ToyUniverse_Research_Paper_Continuation.html` (Further research notes)
- `messagefordeveloper.md` (Previous specific instructions for development tasks)
- `forgot.md` (Previous "catch-up" notes on project status)

This file focuses on the *current* long-duration GPU simulation and the decisions related to it.

## 2. Current Major Activity: Long-Duration GPU Simulation

We are currently executing a long-duration 2D simulation of the coupled ID14-ID26 Toy Universe model using GPU acceleration (CuPy).

**Objective of this specific run:**
- To investigate the long-term stability and evolutionary behavior of a "spot-forming" parameter regime.
- To observe if patterns persist, evolve (e.g., coarsen, drift), or if new phenomena emerge over extended time scales.

**Key Simulation Parameters for this Run (`id14_id26_simulation.py`):**
- `USE_GPU = True`
- **Spot-Forming Regime:**
    - `gamma_Phi_PDE = 0.01`
    - `k_R_phi_prime = 0.01` (acting as `delta_psi_d_p`)
    - `Phi0_saturation_alpha = 0.5`
    - `Phi0_saturation_epsilon = 0.5`
- **Duration & Animation:**
    - `t_max = 10000.0` (Target simulation end time)
    - `dt = 0.001` (Time step)
    - `num_steps = 10,000,000` (Total PDE integration steps)
    - `ENABLE_ANIMATION = True`
    - `ANIMATION_FRAME_INTERVAL = 33300` (Aiming for ~300 frames)

**Simulation Command ID:** `102` (Background command)

## 3. Current Status of the Long Run (as of 2025-06-08 00:25 UTC)

- **Execution Time:** Approximately 1 hour.
- **Current Step:** ~126,854 / 10,000,000
- **Current Simulation Time `t`:** ~126.85 / 10000.0
- **Progress:** ~1.27% complete.
- **Estimated Remaining Time:** Approximately 107 hours (around 4.5 days). This is significantly longer than initially anticipated.
- **Data Collected So Far:**
    - Time-series data (`I`, `R`, `Psi_ID14`, `Avg(Phi_field)`) up to `t = 126.85` (approx. 1268 data points).
    - Animation frames: 4 frames collected (initial, `t=33.3`, `t=66.6`, `t=99.9`).

## 4. CRITICAL DECISION POINT / Immediate Next Step

Given the very long revised estimated time to completion for the current simulation (ID `102`), a decision is needed on how to proceed:

**Option 1: Continue the Current Run**
- Allow the simulation to continue running for the estimated ~107 more hours.
- Periodically check its progress.

**Option 2: Stop and Analyze Current Progress**
- Terminate the current simulation (ID `102`).
- Analyze the data collected so far:
    - Generate animation from the ~4 collected frames (up to `t=99.9`).
    - Plot time-series data (up to `t=126.8`).
- This will provide insights into the initial phase of this parameter set over a duration comparable to previous full (shorter) runs.

**Option 3: Stop and Reconfigure**
- Terminate the current simulation (ID `102`).
- Based on observations or new priorities, reconfigure for a different run:
    - **Shorter `T_final`**: e.g., `500.0` or `1000.0` for faster feedback.
    - **Adjust Animation**: Further increase `ANIMATION_FRAME_INTERVAL` or set `ENABLE_ANIMATION = False` if animation data handling is suspected to be a major bottleneck (unlikely with current interval).
    - **Modify Parameters**: If the current slow rate or early behavior suggests the parameters are not ideal for the intended long-term study within a practical timeframe.

**The next action from the USER should be to choose one of these options.**

## 5. Broader Context & Future Goals (Post-Decision on Current Run)

Once the decision regarding the current long run is made and acted upon:
- If continuing, monitor the run.
- If stopping and analyzing, perform the analysis and then decide on subsequent runs.
- If reconfiguring, implement changes and start the new run.

Longer-term goals (as discussed with the "scientist" and in `messagefordeveloper.md` / `forgot.md`) include:
- Characterizing different pattern regimes (spots, labyrinths).
- Exploring larger grid sizes.
- Performing parameter sweeps on GPU.
- Investigating "awakening" phenomena in more detail.

This checkpoint ensures that if we resume work, the immediate status and decision point are clear.
